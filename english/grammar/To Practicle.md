## The Emphatic "DO"

Sometimes we add "do" before the main verb of the sentence.
This is called **the Emphatic do**, and it is very common in **spoken English** when we want to **add emphasis** to affirmative sentences.

> "I did follow the instructions to the letter.”

This example suggests there was a problem and the speaker emphasises that they did everything they were supposed to do. 

**With _really_ or _absolutely_, the Emphatic "do" is also common.**

> “I really did follow every instruction to the letter.”

**For questions or confirmation, also:**

> “They do understand the gravity of missing this deadline, don’t they?”

## Dependent Prepositions

Certain verbs, nouns, or adjectives are always followed by specific prepositions.
We say _listen to_, _depend on_, _incapable of_, _rely on_, _impact on_, _increase in_.
The following sentences would be incorrect without the prepositions.

> “You should listen to the instructions carefully.” 
> 
> “The preposition depends on the verb, noun or adjective that comes before it.”
> 
> “You are not incapable of learning.”
> 
> “You can rely on the firewall to catch threats.” 
> 
> “The impact on productivity has to be addressed.” 
> 
> “The increase in threats has to be considered seriously.”

You should try to **learn the dependent preposition** with the **verb,** **noun,** or **adjective** in order to remember they are necessary.
