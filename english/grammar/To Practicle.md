- As if / As though
- The emphatic do


### Sometimes we add "do" before the main verb of the sentence.

This is called **the Emphatic do**, and it is very common in **spoken English** when we want to **add emphasis** to affirmative sentences.

> "I did follow the instructions to the letter.”

This example suggests there was a problem and the speaker emphasises that they did everything they were supposed to do. 

### With _really_ or _absolutely_, the Emphatic "do" is also **common**.

> “I really did follow every instruction to the letter.”

### For questions or confirmation, also:

> “They do understand the gravity of missing this deadline, don’t they?”
