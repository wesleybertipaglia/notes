# English Nouns
English nouns are words that represent people, places, things, or ideas. They're the building blocks of sentences, serving as subjects or objects. Nouns can be classified into various categories based on their characteristics:

### Common Nouns
These refer to general, everyday items or concepts, such as "book," "city," or "idea."

### Proper Nouns
These are specific names of people, places, or things, like "John," "London," or "Eiffel Tower."

### Concrete Nouns
These are tangible items that can be perceived through the senses, such as "table," "dog," or "rain."

### Abstract Nouns
These represent concepts, feelings, or qualities that are intangible, like "love," "happiness," or "freedom."

### Countable Nouns
These can be counted and have both singular and plural forms, such as "cat" (singular) and "cats" (plural).

### Uncountable Nouns
These cannot be counted individually, like "water," "information," or "advice."

### Collective Nouns
These refer to groups of people or things, such as "team," "family," or "herd."
