## Binary
Is a conjunct of 0's and 1's that represents any type of data in a computer, like numbers, texts, images, videos, sounds, and more.

## Binary can be divided in 3 groups

| Unit   | Quantity | Number of Patterns |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------ |
| Bit    | 1 bit    | 2                  |
| Byte   | 8 bits   | 256                |
| Binary | n bytes  | n  * 256           |

> The computer process data in group of bytes (8 bits), and
> the byte is also the smallest addressable unit of a computer memory.

## Bits
- a "bit" is atomic: the smallest unit of storage
- A bit stores just a 0 or 1
- Anything with two separate states can store 1 bit
- In a chip: electric charge = 0/1
- In a hard drive: spots of North/South magnetism = 0/1

## Bytes
- 1 byte is group of 8 bits
- 8 bits can make 256 different patterns
- One byte can hold a number between 0 and 255
- One byte can store one character, e.g. 'A' or 'x' or '$'
- e.g. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
