Hexadecimal encoding is a numerical system commonly used in computing and digital communication to represent numbers, characters, and data. Hexadecimal encoding utilizes a base-16 numeral system, allowing representation using the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F.

### Hexadecimal Units

| Unit        | Value             | Number of Symbols |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Hex Digit   | 1 digit           | 16                |
| Byte        | 2 hex digits      | 256               |
| Word        | 4 hex digits      | 65,536            |
| Quad Word   | 8 hex digits      | 4,294,967,296     |

> Hexadecimal encoding is widely used in computer science due to its compact representation and compatibility with binary data.

### Hex Digits
- Hex digits represent values from 0 to 15, using the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F.
- Each hex digit is equivalent to 4 bits in binary encoding, providing a convenient grouping mechanism.

### Bytes
- A byte in hexadecimal encoding is represented by 2 hex digits, allowing for 256 unique patterns.
- Hexadecimal encoding is frequently used to represent bytes of data, such as memory addresses, binary files, and network packets.

### Words and Quad Words
- Larger data units, such as words and quad words, are represented by 4 and 8 hex digits, respectively.
- These larger units are commonly used in computer architecture and memory addressing schemes.

### Usage
- Hexadecimal encoding is widely used in programming, debugging, and digital communication protocols.
- It's often used to represent binary data in a more human-readable and compact format.
- Hexadecimal notation is also prevalent in cryptographic algorithms, network protocols, and low-level system programming.
