- **Document-Oriented**: They store data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON format, making it easy to work with hierarchical data.
- **Query Flexibility**: Document databases support rich query capabilities, including indexing and querying nested data.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Many document databases support horizontal scalability, allowing them to distribute data across multiple nodes.
- **High Performance**: They offer high performance for read and write operations, making them suitable for real-time applications.

#### Use Cases
- **Content Management**: Document databases are commonly used for content management systems, allowing for flexible storage of articles, blog posts, and multimedia content.
- **Catalog Management**: They are used for product catalog management in e-commerce applications, enabling flexible representation of product attributes and categories.
- **User Profiles**: Document databases are suitable for storing and managing user profiles, preferences, and social network data.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: They are used in applications requiring real-time analytics, such as monitoring dashboards and recommendation systems.

#### Examples
- **MongoDB**: A popular open-source document database known for its flexibility, scalability, and rich query capabilities.
- **Couchbase**: An open-source, distributed document database with built-in caching and support for mobile and IoT applications.
- **Amazon DocumentDB**: A fully managed document database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), compatible with MongoDB applications.
