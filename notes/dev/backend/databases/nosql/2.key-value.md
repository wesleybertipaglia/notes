# Key Value Databases

Store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Each data record is associated with a unique key, and the value can be any type of data, such as a string, number, JSON document, or even a binary blob. 

#### Characteristics
- **Simple Data Model**: Key-value databases have a simple data model where each piece of data is stored with a unique key.
- **High Performance**: They offer high performance for simple read and write operations, making them suitable for caching and session storage.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Many key-value databases support horizontal scalability, allowing them to distribute data across multiple nodes.
- **Schemaless**: They typically do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing flexibility in data structure.
- **Low Latency**: Key-value databases are optimized for low-latency operations, making them suitable for real-time applications.

#### Use Cases
- **Caching**: Key-value databases are commonly used for caching frequently accessed data to improve application performance.
- **Session Storage**: They are used for managing user sessions in web applications, providing fast and scalable session storage.
- **Distributed Systems**: Key-value databases are suitable for building distributed systems that require fast and scalable data access.
- **Ad Tech**: They are used in advertising technology platforms for managing ad impressions, user profiles, and targeting criteria.

#### Examples
- **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory data structure store known for its high performance and support for various data types.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed key-value and document database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- **Apache Cassandra**: A distributed key-value store designed for high availability and horizontal scalability.
