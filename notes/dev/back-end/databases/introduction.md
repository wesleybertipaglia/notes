## DataBases
Databases are organized collections of data that are designed to be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. They serve as centralized repositories for various types of data, ranging from simple text to complex multimedia content.

## Types of Databases
### SQL (relational)

Organize data into tables with rows and columns, and use structured query language (SQL) for manipulation.

Popular SQL Databases:
- SQLite
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server
- Oracle

### NoSQL

Designed for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexible schemas and scalability. Types include document-oriented (e.g., MongoDB), key-value (e.g., Redis), column-oriented (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).

Popular NOSQL Databases:
- MongoDB
- Firebase
- Redis
- Cassandra

### NewSQL

Combine the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability of NoSQL solutions. Examples include Google Spanner and CockroachDB.

## Components 
### Data
Information stored in the database, organized into tables or collections.

### DBMS (Database Management System)
Software that enables users to interact with the database, manage data, and perform operations such as querying, updating, and deleting records.

### Schema
Defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.

### Queries
Commands or statements used to retrieve specific data from the database.

### Indexes
Data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval by allowing quick lookup of records based on certain criteria.

### Transactions
Logical units of work performed on the database that are either fully completed or fully aborted, ensuring data integrity.

## Key Concepts:

### ACID Properties
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. These properties ensure that database transactions are reliable and maintain data integrity.

### Normalization
Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency.

### Backup and Recovery
Strategies for protecting data against loss or corruption, including regular backups and disaster recovery plans.

### Concurrency Control
Mechanisms to manage simultaneous access to data by multiple users or processes, preventing inconsistencies.
