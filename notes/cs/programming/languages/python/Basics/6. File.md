The key function for working with files in Python is the `open()` function. The `open()` function takes two parameters; _filename_, and _mode_. There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

- `r` - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
- `a` - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
- `w` - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
- `x` - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
- `t` - Text - Default value. Text mode
- `b` - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

```python
f = open("demofile.txt")
f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")
```

## Creating and Deleting Files

```python
import os

f = open("myfile.txt", "x") # create
os.path.exists("demofile.txt") # check if it exists
os.remove("myfile.txt") # delete
os.rmdir("myfolder") # delete a folder
```
## Reading

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```

## Writing

```python
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!\n')
```

## Appending

```python
with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('Appending to the file.\n')
```

## Reading and Writing Binary Files

```python
# Open a binary file in read mode
with open('binary.bin', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Open a binary file in write mode
with open('binary.bin', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(b'\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\x2c\x20\x77\x6f\x72\x6c\x64\x21')
```
