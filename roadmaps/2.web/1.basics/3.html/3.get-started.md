# Getting Started

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of HTML, including the structure of an HTML document, commonly used HTML tags, and how to create a simple web page.

## Step 1: Understanding the Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document is composed of various elements, including tags, attributes, and content. Here's the basic structure of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Specifies the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as title, character encoding, and viewport settings.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the document, including text, images, links, and other elements.

## Step 2: Using HTML Tags

HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Here are some commonly used HTML tags:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Headings of different levels.
- `<p>`: Paragraph.
- `<a>`: Anchor (link).
- `<img>`: Image.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Unordered list, ordered list, list item.
- `<div>`, `<span>`: Generic container elements.
- `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`: Table, table row, table data cell, table header cell.

## Step 3: Create a Simple Web Page

Let's create a simple web page that displays a heading, paragraph, and an image:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page created using HTML.</p>
    <img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Image">
</body>
</html>
```

Replace `"https://example.com/image.jpg"` with the URL of the image you want to display.

## Step 4: View the Web Page

1. Save the HTML code to a file with a `.html` extension, for example, `index.html`.
    
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
    
3. You should see your web page displayed in the browser with the heading, paragraph, and image.
    

Congratulations! You've just created your first web page using HTML. From here, you can explore more advanced HTML features, such as forms, tables, semantic elements, and CSS styling, to enhance the appearance and functionality of your web pages.
