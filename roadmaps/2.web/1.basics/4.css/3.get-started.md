# Getting Started

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of CSS, including how to apply styles to HTML elements, using selectors, and working with different CSS properties.

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics of CSS

CSS is used to style the appearance of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, sizes, margins, padding, and more. Here's the basic syntax of a CSS rule:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

- `selector`: Specifies which HTML elements the style should be applied to.
- `property`: Specifies the CSS property to be styled.
- `value`: Specifies the value of the CSS property.

## Step 2: Applying Styles to HTML Elements

You can apply styles to HTML elements using various CSS selectors. Here are some commonly used selectors:

- Element Selector: Selects all instances of a specific HTML element.
- Class Selector: Selects elements with a specific class attribute.
- ID Selector: Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
- Attribute Selector: Selects elements with a specific attribute.

## Step 3: Create a Simple CSS Stylesheet

Let's create a simple CSS stylesheet to style the appearance of HTML elements. Save the following CSS code to a file named `styles.css`:

```css
/* styles.css */

/* Apply styles to heading elements */
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}

/* Apply styles to paragraph elements */
p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 16px;
}

/* Apply styles to elements with class "highlight" */
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* Apply styles to elements with ID "container" */
#container {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

## Step 4: Link CSS Stylesheet to HTML Document

To apply the styles defined in the CSS stylesheet to an HTML document, you need to link the stylesheet using the `<link>` tag in the HTML document's `<head>` section. Save the following HTML code to a file named `index.html`:

```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My CSS Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My CSS Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph with some text.</p>
    <p class="highlight">This paragraph has the "highlight" class.</p>
    <div id="container">
        <p>This paragraph is inside a container.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 5: View the Styled Web Page

1. Save both the `styles.css` and `index.html` files in the same directory.
    
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
    
3. You should see the web page displayed with the specified styles applied to the HTML elements.
    

Congratulations! You've just created a simple web page and applied styles to it using CSS. From here, you can explore more advanced CSS features, such as layout techniques, responsive design, animations, and CSS frameworks, to enhance the appearance and functionality of your web pages.
