# Getting Started

Less is a dynamic stylesheet language that is compiled into CSS. It provides features such as variables, mixins, nested rules, and more to make writing CSS more efficient and maintainable. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing Less, writing Less code, compiling Less to CSS, and integrating Less into your projects.

## Step 1: Install Less

1. Install Less via npm (Node.js package manager) by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm install -g less
    ```

   Alternatively, you can use Yarn (another package manager) to install Less:

    ```bash
    yarn global add less
    ```

2. Once installed, you can verify the installation by running the following command:

    ```bash
    lessc --version
    ```

## Step 2: Write Less Code

1. Create a new Less file with a `.less` extension (e.g., `styles.less`) in your project directory.

2. Write your Less code using Less features such as variables, mixins, nested rules, and more. Here's an example:

    ```less
    @primary-color: #ff0000;

    .container {
        max-width: 1200px;
        margin: 0 auto;

        .header {
            background-color: @primary-color;
            color: white;
            padding: 20px;

            h1 {
                font-size: 24px;
            }
        }

        .content {
            padding: 20px;
        }
    }
    ```

## Step 3: Compile Less to CSS

1. Compile your Less file to CSS using the following command:

    ```bash
    lessc input.less output.css
    ```

   Replace `input.less` with the name of your Less file and `output.css` with the desired output CSS file name.

2. Optionally, you can watch for changes in your Less file and automatically compile it to CSS whenever changes are detected using the `--watch` flag:

    ```bash
    lessc --watch input.less output.css
    ```

## Step 4: Link the Compiled CSS File to Your HTML

1. Link the compiled CSS file generated by Less to your HTML file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="output.css">
    ```

   Replace `output.css` with the name of the compiled CSS file.

## Step 5: Integrate Less into Your Projects

1. Integrate Less into your projects by organizing your Less files, using import statements, leveraging features like mixins and functions, and compiling Less to CSS as part of your build process.

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with Less. From here, you can explore more advanced Less features, experiment with different Less architectures, and use Less to write modular and maintainable CSS for your projects.
