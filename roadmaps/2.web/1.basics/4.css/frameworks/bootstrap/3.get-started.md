# Getting Started

Bootstrap is a powerful CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and mobile-first web projects. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of including Bootstrap in your project, using Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities to create responsive layouts and enhance the appearance of your web pages.

## Step 1: Include Bootstrap in Your Project

1. Visit the official Bootstrap website to download Bootstrap or link to the Bootstrap CDN: [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/)

2. To include Bootstrap in your HTML document, add the following `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    ```

   You can also download Bootstrap and link to the local CSS file instead.

## Step 2: Use Bootstrap Grid System

Bootstrap's grid system allows you to create responsive layouts with ease. The grid system is based on a 12-column layout. Here's an example of using Bootstrap's grid system:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            Column 1
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            Column 2
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

This will create a row with two columns, each taking up half of the container width on medium-sized screens and above.

## Step 3: Use Bootstrap Components

Bootstrap provides a variety of pre-styled components such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, cards, and more. Here's an example of using Bootstrap components:

```css
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
<form>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label>
        <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp">
        <small id="emailHelp" class="form-text text-muted">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small>
    </div>
</form>
```

## Step 4: Use Bootstrap Utilities

Bootstrap utilities provide helper classes for common CSS properties, such as spacing, colors, typography, and more. Here's an example of using Bootstrap utilities:

```css
<div class="container">
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">Primary background with white text</div>
</div>
```

This will create a container with a blue background, white text, and padding on all sides.

## Step 5: Explore Bootstrap Documentation

Bootstrap has extensive documentation with examples, components, and utilities. Explore the Bootstrap documentation to learn more about all the available features: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/
