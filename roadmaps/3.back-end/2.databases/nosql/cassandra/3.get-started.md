# Getting Started

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database management system designed for handling large volumes of data across multiple nodes. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing Cassandra, setting up a cluster, creating a keyspace, and performing some basic database operations.

## Step 1: Install Apache Cassandra

1. Visit the official Apache Cassandra website to download Cassandra: [http://cassandra.apache.org/download/](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/)

2. Download and install Cassandra for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by Apache Cassandra for your platform.

3. Once installed, ensure that the Cassandra service is running. You can start or restart the service as needed using system-specific commands.

## Step 2: Connect to Cassandra

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Connect to the Cassandra cluster using the `cqlsh` command-line utility, which is a Cassandra Query Language (CQL) shell:

    ```bash
    cqlsh
    ```

3. You should see a Cassandra command prompt indicating a successful connection to the Cassandra cluster.

## Step 3: Create a Keyspace

1. Once connected to Cassandra, you can create a new keyspace using CQL commands. A keyspace is a namespace that defines data replication on nodes. Use the following CQL command to create a new keyspace:

    ```cql
    CREATE KEYSPACE mykeyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
    ```

2. Verify that the keyspace has been created by listing all keyspaces:

    ```cql
    DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;
    ```

## Step 4: Create a Table

1. After creating a keyspace, you can create a new table within that keyspace. Use the following CQL command to create a simple table called `users` with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns:

    ```cql
    USE mykeyspace;

    CREATE TABLE users (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        email TEXT
    );
    ```

2. Verify that the table has been created by describing the table structure:

    ```cql
    DESCRIBE TABLE users;
    ```

## Step 5: Insert Data into the Table

1. Once the table is created, you can insert data into it. Use the following CQL command to insert a new user into the `users` table:

    ```cql
    INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (uuid(), 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');
    ```

2. Verify that the data has been inserted by querying the `users` table:

    ```cql
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

3. You should see the inserted user data displayed in the result.

## Step 6: Perform Basic Database Operations

1. Now that you have a keyspace and a table with data, you can perform basic database operations such as selecting, updating, and deleting data using CQL commands.

2. Experiment with different CQL commands to perform operations like selecting specific columns, updating existing records, and deleting records.

## Step 7: Exit Cassandra Shell

1. Once you're done working with Cassandra, you can exit the Cassandra shell by typing:

    ```cql
    exit;
    ```

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with Apache Cassandra. From here, you can explore more advanced features and capabilities offered by Cassandra.
