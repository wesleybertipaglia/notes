# Getting Started

TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database optimized for fast ingest and complex queries on time-series data. It is built on top of PostgreSQL, providing scalability, performance, and reliability. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing TimescaleDB, setting up a database, inserting data, querying data, and performing some basic database operations using the PostgreSQL command-line interface (CLI) and TimescaleDB's capabilities.

## Step 1: Install TimescaleDB Extension

1. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system. If not, install PostgreSQL first.

2. Visit the official TimescaleDB website to download and install the TimescaleDB extension: [https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/installation](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/installation)

3. Follow the installation instructions provided by TimescaleDB for your platform.

4. Once installed, connect to your PostgreSQL instance using the PostgreSQL CLI.

## Step 2: Create a TimescaleDB Database

1. After connecting to PostgreSQL, create a new database using the following SQL command:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
    ```

2. Switch to the newly created database:

    ```sql
    \c mydatabase
    ```

3. Enable the TimescaleDB extension in the database:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;
    ```

## Step 3: Create a TimescaleDB Hypertable

1. In TimescaleDB, a hypertable is a distributed table that is partitioned across multiple chunks for efficient storage and query processing.

2. Create a hypertable using the following SQL command:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE mytable (
        time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        value DOUBLE PRECISION
    );

    SELECT create_hypertable('mytable', 'time');
    ```

## Step 4: Insert Data into the Hypertable

1. After creating the hypertable, you can insert time-series data into it using standard SQL insert statements.

2. Insert data into the hypertable using the following SQL command:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO mytable (time, value) VALUES ('2024-03-29 00:00:00', 10.5);
    ```

## Step 5: Query Data from the Hypertable

1. Once data is inserted into the hypertable, you can query it using SQL queries.

2. Query data from the hypertable using standard SQL select statements:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM mytable;
    ```

## Step 6: Perform Basic Database Operations

1. Now that you have a hypertable and data in it, you can perform basic database operations such as updating and deleting data.

2. Use standard SQL update and delete statements to perform operations on the hypertable.

## Step 7: Explore TimescaleDB Features

1. TimescaleDB provides advanced features for working with time-series data, including automatic data retention policies, continuous aggregates, and more.

2. Explore the TimescaleDB documentation to learn about advanced features and capabilities: [https://docs.timescale.com/latest/](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/)

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with TimescaleDB. From here, you can explore more advanced features and capabilities offered by TimescaleDB for working with time-series data.
