# Getting Started

SQLite is a lightweight and embedded relational database management system known for its simplicity, portability, and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of using SQLite, including installation, database creation, table creation, data insertion, and basic SQL queries.

## Step 1: Install SQLite

1. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless database engine, and it does not require any installation process like traditional database systems. You can simply download the SQLite command-line shell (sqlite3) from the official SQLite website: [https://sqlite.org/download.html](https://sqlite.org/download.html)

2. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and extract it to a directory of your choice.

## Step 2: Open the SQLite Command-Line Shell

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the SQLite binary.

3. Run the SQLite command-line shell by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    ./sqlite3
    ```

   This command will open the SQLite command-line shell and display a prompt where you can enter SQL commands.

## Step 3: Create a Database

1. Once inside the SQLite command-line shell, you can create a new SQLite database file by executing the following command:

    ```sql
    .open mydatabase.db
    ```

   This command will create a new SQLite database file named `mydatabase.db` in the current directory.

## Step 4: Create a Table

1. After creating a database, you can create a new table within that database. Use the following SQL command to create a simple table called `users` with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        email TEXT
    );
    ```

## Step 5: Insert Data into the Table

1. Once the table is created, you can insert data into it. Use the following SQL command to insert a new user into the `users` table:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
    ```

## Step 6: Perform Basic SQL Queries

1. Now that you have a database and a table with data, you can perform basic SQL queries to retrieve, update, and delete data.

   - To retrieve all rows from the `users` table:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users;
     ```

   - To retrieve specific columns from the `users` table:

     ```sql
     SELECT name, email FROM users;
     ```

   - To update a record in the `users` table:

     ```sql
     UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
     ```

   - To delete a record from the `users` table:

     ```sql
     DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
     ```

## Step 7: Exit SQLite Command-Line Shell

1. Once you're done working with SQLite, you can exit the SQLite command-line shell by typing:

    ```sql
    .exit
    ```

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with SQLite. From here, you can explore more advanced features and capabilities offered by SQLite.
