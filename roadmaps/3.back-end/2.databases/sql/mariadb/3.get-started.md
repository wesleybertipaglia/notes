# Getting Started

MariaDB is a popular open-source relational database management system, known for its performance, scalability, and robustness. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing MariaDB, connecting to it, and performing some basic database operations.

## Step 1: Install MariaDB

1. Visit the official MariaDB website to download the latest version of MariaDB: [https://mariadb.org/download/](https://mariadb.org/download/)

2. Download and install MariaDB for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform.

3. Once installed, ensure that the MariaDB service is running. You can start or restart the service as needed using system-specific commands.

## Step 2: Connect to MariaDB

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Connect to the MariaDB server using the command-line client. Replace `[username]` and `[password]` with your MariaDB username and password:

    ```bash
    mysql -u [username] -p
    ```

3. You'll be prompted to enter your MariaDB password. After entering the password, you should see a MariaDB command prompt.

## Step 3: Create a Database

1. Once connected to MariaDB, you can create a new database using the following SQL command. Replace `[database_name]` with the name you want for your database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE [database_name];
    ```

2. Verify that the database has been created by listing all databases:

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

## Step 4: Create a Table

1. After creating a database, you can create a new table within that database. Use the following SQL command to create a simple table called `users` with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns:

    ```sql
    USE [database_name];

    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50),
        email VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```

2. Verify that the table has been created by listing all tables in the database:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

## Step 5: Insert Data into the Table

1. Once the table is created, you can insert data into it. Use the following SQL command to insert a new user into the `users` table:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
    ```

2. Verify that the data has been inserted by querying the `users` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

3. You should see the inserted user data displayed in the result.

## Step 6: Perform Basic Database Operations

1. Now that you have a database and a table with data, you can perform basic database operations such as selecting, updating, and deleting data.

2. Experiment with different SQL commands to perform operations like selecting specific columns, updating existing records, and deleting records.

## Step 7: Disconnect from MariaDB

1. Once you're done working with MariaDB, you can disconnect from the MariaDB server by typing:

    ```sql
    exit;
    ```

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with MariaDB. From here, you can explore more advanced database operations and features offered by MariaDB.
