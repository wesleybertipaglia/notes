# Getting Started

Oracle Database is a powerful and widely-used relational database management system known for its scalability, reliability, and comprehensive feature set. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing Oracle Database, connecting to it, and performing some basic database operations.

## Step 1: Install Oracle Database

1. Visit the official Oracle website to download Oracle Database: [https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/)

2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system. You may need to create an Oracle account or sign in to download the software.

3. Follow the installation instructions provided by Oracle for your platform. The installation process may vary depending on your operating system and version of Oracle Database.

4. Once installed, ensure that the Oracle Database service is running. You can start or restart the service as needed using system-specific commands.

## Step 2: Connect to Oracle Database

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Connect to the Oracle Database using the SQL*Plus command-line utility or another SQL client. Replace `[username]` with your Oracle Database username and `[password]` with your Oracle Database password:

    ```bash
    sqlplus [username]/[password]
    ```

3. You'll be prompted to enter your Oracle Database password. After entering the password, you should see an Oracle Database command prompt.

## Step 3: Create a Table

1. Once connected to Oracle Database, you can create a new table. Use the following SQL command to create a simple table called `employees` with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR2(50),
        email VARCHAR2(100)
    );
    ```

2. Verify that the table has been created by querying the `user_tables` view:

    ```sql
    SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;
    ```

## Step 4: Insert Data into the Table

1. After creating the table, you can insert data into it. Use the following SQL command to insert a new employee into the `employees` table:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');
    ```

2. Verify that the data has been inserted by querying the `employees` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees;
    ```

3. You should see the inserted employee data displayed in the result.

## Step 5: Perform Basic Database Operations

1. Now that you have a table with data, you can perform basic database operations such as selecting, updating, and deleting data.

2. Experiment with different SQL commands to perform operations like selecting specific columns, updating existing records, and deleting records.

## Step 6: Disconnect from Oracle Database

1. Once you're done working with Oracle Database, you can disconnect by typing:

    ```sql
    EXIT;
    ```

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with Oracle Database. From here, you can explore more advanced database operations and features offered by Oracle Database.
