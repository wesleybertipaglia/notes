# Getting Started

Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes database access easy with type safety and auto-generated queries. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a simple application using Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes bundled with Node.js installation.
- PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and ensure it's running on your machine.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-prisma-app
    ```

2. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-prisma-app
    ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

## Step 2: Installing Prisma CLI and Generating Prisma Client

1. Install Prisma CLI globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g prisma
    ```

2. Initialize Prisma in your project directory:

    ```bash
    prisma init
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to select PostgreSQL as your database and set up your database connection.

4. Generate Prisma Client:

    ```bash
    prisma generate
    ```

## Step 3: Creating Your First Model and Migrating Database

1. Define your data model in `schema.prisma`:

    ```prisma
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    model User {
      id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
      email String @unique
      name  String
    }
    ```

2. Apply migrations to create database tables:

    ```bash
    prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

## Step 4: Using Prisma Client in Your Application

1. Install `@prisma/client` as a dependency:

    ```bash
    npm install @prisma/client
    ```

2. Use Prisma Client in your application code to perform database operations:

    ```javascript
    const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
    const prisma = new PrismaClient();

    async function main() {
      const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
        data: {
          email: 'test@example.com',
          name: 'Test User'
        }
      });
      console.log('Created user:', newUser);
    }

    main()
      .catch(e => {
        throw e;
      })
      .finally(async () => {
        await prisma.$disconnect();
      });
    ```

## Step 5: Running Your Prisma Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Run your application:

    ```bash
    node your-app.js
    ```

3. Check your PostgreSQL database to verify that the user was created successfully.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first application using Prisma ORM. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful database-backed applications with Prisma.
