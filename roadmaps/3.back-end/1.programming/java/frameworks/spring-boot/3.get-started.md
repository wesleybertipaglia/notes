# Getting Started with Spring Boot for Java

Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based applications with minimal setup and configuration. It simplifies the development of production-ready applications by providing a convention-over-configuration approach. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a Spring Boot project with Java and creating a simple web application.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Java Project

1. Create a new directory for your Spring Boot project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-spring-boot-app
    ```

2. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-spring-boot-app
    ```

3. Initialize a new Gradle project:

    ```bash
    gradle init --type java-application
    ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your project.

## Step 2: Add Spring Boot Dependencies

1. Open the `build.gradle` file in your project directory.

2. Add the following dependencies for Spring Boot:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    }
    ```

   This adds the Spring Boot starter for building web applications.

## Step 3: Create a Spring Boot Application

1. Create a new Java file for your Spring Boot application, e.g., `Application.java`.

2. Open `Application.java` in your favorite text editor.

3. Write your Spring Boot application code. For example:

    ```java
    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class Application {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        }
    }

    @RestController
    class HelloController {

        @GetMapping("/")
        public String hello() {
            return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
        }
    }
    ```

4. Save the file.

## Step 4: Run Your Spring Boot Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your `Application.java` file is located.

2. Run your Spring Boot application using Gradle:

    ```bash
    gradle bootRun
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the message "Hello, Spring Boot!" displayed in the browser.

## Step 5: Exploring Spring Boot Features

1. Spring Boot provides many features out of the box, including auto-configuration, embedded servers, RESTful services, and more.

2. You can define controllers, services, repositories, and other components using Java in your Spring Boot applications.

3. Explore the official Spring Boot documentation and tutorials for detailed guides, examples, and best practices: [https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first Spring Boot application with Java. From here, you can explore more advanced Spring Boot features and build powerful web applications with ease.
