# Getting

Laravel is a powerful PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a Laravel development environment and creating a simple Laravel application.

## Step 1: Install Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that is used to manage packages and libraries in your PHP projects. Follow the instructions below to install Composer:

1. Visit the Composer website: [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Once installed, you can verify that Composer is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```

## Step 2: Install Laravel

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Use Composer to create a new Laravel project:

    ```bash
    composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
    ```

3. Navigate into your Laravel project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-laravel-app
    ```

## Step 3: Setting Up Your Laravel Project

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Generate the application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

## Step 4: Creating Your First Laravel Application

1. Use Artisan, Laravel's command-line interface, to create a new controller:

    ```bash
    php artisan make:controller HelloController
    ```

2. Open the newly created controller file `app/Http/Controllers/HelloController.php` in your favorite text editor.

3. Add a method to the controller to handle the request:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Http\Request;

    class HelloController extends Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            return 'Hello, Laravel!';
        }
    }
    ```

## Step 5: Routing Your Laravel Application

1. Open the `routes/web.php` file in your Laravel project.

2. Define a route that maps a URL to the controller method:

    ```php
    <?php

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
    use App\Http\Controllers\HelloController;

    Route::get('/', [HelloController::class, 'index']);
    ```

## Step 6: Running Your Laravel Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to your Laravel project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Use Artisan to start the Laravel development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the message "Hello, Laravel!" displayed in the browser.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first Laravel application. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful web applications with Laravel.
