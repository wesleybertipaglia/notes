# Getting Started

CakePHP is a modern PHP framework that makes building web applications simpler, faster, and require less code. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a CakePHP development environment and creating a simple CakePHP application.

## Step 1: Install Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that is used to manage packages and libraries in your PHP projects. Follow the instructions below to install Composer:

1. Visit the Composer website: [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Once installed, you can verify that Composer is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```

## Step 2: Install CakePHP

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Use Composer to create a new CakePHP project:

    ```bash
    composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app my-cakephp-app
    ```

3. Navigate into your CakePHP project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-cakephp-app
    ```

## Step 3: Setting Up Your CakePHP Project

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.default` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.default .env
    ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure your database settings (e.g., database type, hostname, username, password).

3. Generate the application key:

    ```bash
    bin/cake server
    ```

## Step 4: Creating Your First CakePHP Controller

1. Use the CakePHP Bake command-line tool to generate a new controller:

    ```bash
    bin/cake bake controller Hello
    ```

2. Open the newly created controller file `src/Controller/HelloController.php` in your favorite text editor.

3. Add a method to the controller to handle the request:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Controller;

    class HelloController extends AppController
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $this->set('message', 'Hello, CakePHP!');
        }
    }
    ```

## Step 5: Creating Your First CakePHP View

1. Use the CakePHP Bake command-line tool to generate a new view:

    ```bash
    bin/cake bake template Hello
    ```

2. Open the newly created view file `templates/Hello/index.php` in your favorite text editor.

3. Add the following code to display the message:

    ```php
    <h1><?= h($message) ?></h1>
    ```

## Step 6: Routing Your CakePHP Application

1. Open the `config/routes.php` file in a text editor.

2. Define a route that maps a URL to the controller method:

    ```php
    <?php

    use Cake\Routing\Route\DashedRoute;

    $routes->scope('/', function ($routes) {
        $routes->connect('/hello', ['controller' => 'Hello', 'action' => 'index']);
    });

    $routes->fallbacks(DashedRoute::class);
    ```

## Step 7: Running Your CakePHP Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to your CakePHP project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Use the built-in CakePHP development server to start the application:

    ```bash
    bin/cake server
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8765/hello`. You should see the message "Hello, CakePHP!" displayed in the browser.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first CakePHP application. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful web applications with CakePHP.
