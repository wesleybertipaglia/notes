# Getting Started

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a FastAPI development environment and creating a simple FastAPI application.

## Step 1: Install FastAPI

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Use pip, the Python package installer, to install FastAPI:

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

## Step 2: Creating a FastAPI Application

1. Create a new Python file for your FastAPI application, e.g., `app.py`.

2. Open `app.py` in your favorite text editor.

3. Write your FastAPI application code. For example:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    def read_root():
        return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}
    ```

4. Save the file.

## Step 3: Running Your FastAPI Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located.

2. Use the Uvicorn ASGI server to run your FastAPI application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the message "Hello, FastAPI!" displayed in the browser.

## Step 4: Exploring FastAPI Features

1. FastAPI provides many features out of the box, including automatic validation, serialization, interactive API documentation (Swagger UI), and more.

2. You can define path parameters, query parameters, request bodies, response models, and more using Python type hints.

3. Explore the official FastAPI documentation for detailed guides, tutorials, and examples: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first FastAPI application. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful APIs with FastAPI.
