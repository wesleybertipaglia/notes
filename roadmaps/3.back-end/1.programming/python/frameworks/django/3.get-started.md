# Getting Started

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a Django development environment and creating a simple Django application.

## Step 1: Install Python

1. Visit the Python official website to download the latest version of Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Once installed, you can verify that Python is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

   If you have installed Python 3, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

## Step 2: Install Django

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Use pip, the Python package installer, to install Django:

    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

3. Once installed, you can verify that Django is installed correctly by typing:

    ```bash
    django-admin --version
    ```

## Step 3: Creating a Django Project

1. Create a new directory for your Django project:

    ```bash
    mkdir mydjangoapp
    ```

2. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd mydjangoapp
    ```

3. Use the Django command-line tool to create a new project:

    ```bash
    django-admin startproject myproject
    ```

## Step 4: Running Your Django Project

1. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd myproject
    ```

2. Use the following command to start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Django welcome page.

## Step 5: Creating Your First Django App

1. Use the Django command-line tool to create a new app:

    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp myapp
    ```

2. Open the `myapp/views.py` file in a text editor and define a view function:

    ```python
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
    ```

3. Create a URL pattern for the view in the `myproject/urls.py` file:

    ```python
    from django.urls import path
    from myapp import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ]
    ```

## Step 6: Running Your Django App

1. Start the Django development server if it's not already running:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the message "Hello, Django!" displayed in the browser.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first Django application. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful web applications with Django.
