# Getting Started

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a Python development environment and creating a simple Python application.

## Step 1: Install Python

1. Visit the Python official website to download the latest version of Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Once installed, you can verify that Python is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

   If you have installed Python 3, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

## Step 2: Setting Up Your Python Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-python-app
    ```

2. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-python-app
    ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

## Step 3: Creating Your First Python Application

1. Create a new Python file for your application, e.g., `app.py`.

2. Open `app.py` in your favorite text editor.

3. Write your Python application code. For example:

    ```python
    print("Hello, Python!")
    ```

4. Save the file.

## Step 4: Running Your Python Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Run your Python application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

   If you have installed Python 3, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

3. You should see the message "Hello, Python!" displayed in the terminal.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first Python application. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful applications with Python.
