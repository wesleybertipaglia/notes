# Getting Started

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases, offering a simple yet powerful way to interact with databases. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a simple application using Sequelize with a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes bundled with Node.js installation.
- PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and ensure it's running on your machine.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-sequelize-app
    ```

2. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-sequelize-app
    ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

## Step 2: Installing Sequelize and Database Driver

1. Install Sequelize and the PostgreSQL database driver as dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
    ```

## Step 3: Setting Up Sequelize

1. Create a file named `sequelize.js` in your project directory.

2. Configure Sequelize to connect to your PostgreSQL database:

    ```javascript
    const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

    const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
      host: 'localhost',
      dialect: 'postgres',
    });

    module.exports = sequelize;
    ```

3. Replace `'database'`, `'username'`, and `'password'` with your PostgreSQL database name, username, and password respectively.

## Step 4: Creating Your First Model and Migrating Database

1. Define your data model in a separate file, e.g., `user.js`:

    ```javascript
    const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
    const sequelize = require('./sequelize');

    const User = sequelize.define('User', {
      email: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false,
        unique: true
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false
      }
    });

    module.exports = User;
    ```

2. Apply migrations to create database tables:

    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    ```

## Step 5: Using Sequelize in Your Application

1. Use Sequelize models in your application code to perform database operations:

    ```javascript
    const User = require('./user');

    async function createUser() {
      try {
        const newUser = await User.create({
          email: 'test@example.com',
          name: 'Test User'
        });
        console.log('Created user:', newUser.toJSON());
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating user:', error);
      }
    }

    createUser();
    ```

## Step 6: Running Your Sequelize Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Run your application:

    ```bash
    node your-app.js
    ```

3. Check your PostgreSQL database to verify that the user was created successfully.

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first application using Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL. From here, you can explore more advanced features and build powerful database-backed applications with Sequelize.
