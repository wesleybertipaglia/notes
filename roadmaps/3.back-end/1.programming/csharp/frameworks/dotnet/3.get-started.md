# Getting Started

.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, high-performance applications. It supports various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it suitable for a wide range of development scenarios. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a .NET Core development environment and creating a simple console application.

## Step 1: Install .NET SDK

1. Visit the official .NET website to download the latest version of .NET SDK: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

2. Download and install the .NET SDK for your operating system.

3. Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform.

4. Once installed, you can verify that .NET SDK is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

## Step 2: Create a New .NET Core Console Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for your .NET Core project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-dotnet-app
    ```

3. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-dotnet-app
    ```

4. Create a new console application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet new console
    ```

## Step 3: Write Your First .NET Core Program

1. Open the generated C# file, `Program.cs`, in your favorite text editor.

2. Write your .NET Core program. For example:

    ```csharp
    using System;

    namespace MyDotNetApp
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET Core!");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Save the file.

## Step 4: Build and Run Your .NET Core Program

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your `Program.cs` file is located.

2. Build your .NET Core program using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

3. Run your .NET Core program:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

4. You should see the message "Hello, .NET Core!" displayed in the terminal.

## Step 5: Exploring .NET Core Features

1. .NET Core provides many features, including cross-platform support, high performance, and a rich standard library.

2. You can build various types of applications with .NET Core, including console applications, web applications, microservices, and more.

3. Explore the official .NET Core documentation and tutorials for detailed information, examples, and best practices: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first .NET Core program. From here, you can explore more advanced .NET Core features and build powerful applications for different platforms.
