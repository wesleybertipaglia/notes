# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core for Web Development

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications using C#. It provides a powerful and flexible platform for developing web APIs, web applications, and microservices. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of setting up an ASP.NET Core project and creating a simple web application.

## Step 1: Install .NET SDK

1. Visit the official .NET website to download the latest version of .NET SDK: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

2. Download and install the .NET SDK for your operating system.

3. Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform.

4. Once installed, you can verify that .NET SDK is installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

## Step 2: Create a New ASP.NET Core Web Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for your ASP.NET Core project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-aspnet-core-app
    ```

3. Navigate into your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-aspnet-core-app
    ```

4. Create a new ASP.NET Core web application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet new web
    ```

## Step 3: Run Your ASP.NET Core Web Application

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where your ASP.NET Core project is located.

2. Run your ASP.NET Core web application:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001` (or `http://localhost:5000`). You should see the default ASP.NET Core welcome page.

## Step 4: Explore ASP.NET Core Features

1. ASP.NET Core provides many features out of the box, including built-in dependency injection, middleware pipeline, routing, model binding, and more.

2. You can define controllers, views, models, and other components to build powerful and scalable web applications.

3. Explore the official ASP.NET Core documentation and tutorials for detailed information, examples, and best practices: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

Congratulations! You've just created and run your first ASP.NET Core web application. From here, you can explore more advanced ASP.NET Core features, such as authentication, authorization, data access, and more.
