## Bits
- a "bit" is atomic: the smallest unit of storage
- A bit stores just a 0 or 1
- "In the computer it's all 0's and 1's" ... bits
- Anything with two separate states can store 1 bit
- In a chip: electric charge = 0/1
- In a hard drive: spots of North/South magnetism = 0/1
- A bit is too small to be much use
- Group 8 bits together to make 1 byte

> Everything in a computer is 0's and 1's. The **bit** stores just a 0 or 1: it's the smallest building block of storage.
