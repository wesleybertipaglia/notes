## Binary
Is a conjunct of 0s and 1s that represents any type of data in a computer, like numbers, texts, images, videos, sounds, and more.

## Binary can be divided in 3 groups

| Unit   | Quantity | Representation |
| ------ | -------- | -------------- |
| Bit    | 1 bit    | 2⁰             |
| Byte   | 8 bits   | 2³             |
| Binary | n bytes  | 2 ^ n          |

> the byte is also the smallest addressable unit of a computer memory.
