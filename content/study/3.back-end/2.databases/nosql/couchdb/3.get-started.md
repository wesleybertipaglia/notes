# Getting Started

CouchDB is a distributed NoSQL document-oriented database management system designed for ease of use, scalability, and flexibility. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing CouchDB, accessing the CouchDB dashboard, creating a database, and performing some basic database operations.

## Step 1: Install CouchDB

1. Visit the official CouchDB website to download CouchDB: [https://couchdb.apache.org/#download](https://couchdb.apache.org/#download)

2. Download and install CouchDB for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by CouchDB for your platform.

3. Once installed, ensure that the CouchDB service is running. You can start or restart the service as needed using system-specific commands.

## Step 2: Access the CouchDB Dashboard

1. Open a web browser.

2. Navigate to the CouchDB dashboard using the following URL: [http://localhost:5984/_utils/](http://localhost:5984/_utils/)

3. You should see the CouchDB dashboard, also known as the Futon interface, which provides a graphical user interface for managing CouchDB databases and documents.

## Step 3: Create a Database

1. In the CouchDB dashboard, click on the "Create Database" button.

2. Enter a name for your new database in the "Enter a new database name" field.

3. Click the "Create" button to create the database.

4. You should see a confirmation message indicating that the database has been created successfully.

## Step 4: Insert Data into the Database

1. Once the database is created, you can insert data into it using the CouchDB dashboard.

2. Click on the name of the database you created in the sidebar to navigate to the database page.

3. Click on the "New Document" button to create a new document.

4. Enter the JSON data for your document in the editor provided.

5. Click the "Save Document" button to save the document to the database.

6. You should see a confirmation message indicating that the document has been saved successfully.

## Step 5: Perform Basic Database Operations

1. Now that you have a database and a document with data, you can perform basic database operations such as retrieving, updating, and deleting documents.

2. Use the CouchDB dashboard to explore the available options for performing database operations, such as querying documents, updating documents, and deleting documents.

## Step 6: Access CouchDB via REST API

1. CouchDB provides a RESTful HTTP API for interacting with databases and documents programmatically.

2. You can access the CouchDB REST API using tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client library in your programming language of choice.

3. Refer to the CouchDB documentation for detailed information on using the REST API: [https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/)

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with CouchDB. From here, you can explore more advanced features and capabilities offered by CouchDB.
