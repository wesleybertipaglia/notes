# Getting Started

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing MongoDB, connecting to it, inserting data, querying data, and performing some basic database operations using the MongoDB shell and MongoDB Compass.

## Step 1: Install MongoDB

1. Visit the official MongoDB website to download MongoDB: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

2. Download and install MongoDB for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by MongoDB for your platform.

3. Once installed, ensure that the MongoDB service is running. You can start or restart the service as needed using system-specific commands.

## Step 2: Connect to MongoDB

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Connect to the MongoDB server using the MongoDB shell by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    mongo
    ```

3. You should see a MongoDB command prompt indicating a successful connection to the MongoDB server.

## Step 3: Create a Database

1. Once connected to MongoDB, you can create a new database using the following command:

    ```javascript
    use mydatabase
    ```

   This command will switch to the `mydatabase` database. If the database doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it automatically when you insert data into it.

## Step 4: Insert Data into the Database

1. After selecting a database, you can insert data into it using the following command:

    ```javascript
    db.users.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" })
    ```

   This command will insert a new document into the `users` collection with the specified fields.

## Step 5: Query Data from the Database

1. After inserting data into the database, you can query data from it using the following command:

    ```javascript
    db.users.find()
    ```

   This command will retrieve all documents from the `users` collection.

## Step 6: Perform Basic Database Operations

1. Now that you have a database and data in it, you can perform basic database operations such as updating and deleting documents.

2. Use MongoDB shell commands to perform operations like updating document fields or deleting documents based on specific criteria.

## Step 7: Explore MongoDB Compass

1. MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for MongoDB that provides a visual way to interact with databases and collections.

2. Download and install MongoDB Compass from the MongoDB website: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

3. Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your MongoDB server using the connection details.

4. Explore the databases and collections in your MongoDB server using the intuitive interface of MongoDB Compass.

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with MongoDB. From here, you can explore more advanced features and capabilities offered by MongoDB.
