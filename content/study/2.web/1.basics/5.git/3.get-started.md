# Getting Started

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of installing Git, setting up a Git repository, committing changes, working with branches, and collaborating with others using Git.

## Step 1: Install Git

1. Visit the official Git website to download and install Git: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Download and install Git for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by Git for your platform.

3. Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and verify that Git is installed by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

## Step 2: Configure Git

1. After installing Git, configure your name and email address using the following commands:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```

2. You can also set other Git configurations such as default text editor, merge tool, etc., if needed.

## Step 3: Create a Git Repository

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create a new Git repository.

2. Initialize a new Git repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

3. This will create a new `.git` directory in your current directory, which is the repository where Git stores version control information.

## Step 4: Add and Commit Changes

1. Create or edit files in your Git repository as needed.

2. Add the changes to the staging area using the following command:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

   Replace `.` with the specific file name if you want to add only specific files.

3. Commit the changes to the repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    ```

   Replace `"Commit message"` with a meaningful description of the changes you made.

## Step 5: Create and Switch Branches

1. Create a new branch using the following command:

    ```bash
    git branch new-feature
    ```

   Replace `new-feature` with the name of your new branch.

2. Switch to the new branch using the following command:

    ```bash
    git checkout new-feature
    ```

   Or you can combine the above two steps into one using:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b new-feature
    ```

## Step 6: Collaborate with Others

1. Add a remote repository URL using the following command:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
    ```

2. Push changes to the remote repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```

   Replace `master` with the name of your branch if you're pushing a different branch.

## Step 7: Pull Changes from Remote Repository

1. Fetch changes from the remote repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```

2. Merge the changes into your local branch using the following command:

    ```bash
    git merge origin/master
    ```

Congratulations! You've just completed the basic steps to get started with Git. From here, you can explore more advanced Git features, such as branching strategies, rebasing, resolving conflicts, and working with Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for collaboration.
