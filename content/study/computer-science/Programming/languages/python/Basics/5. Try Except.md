- The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.
- The `except` block lets you handle the error.
- The `else` block lets you execute code when there is no error.
- The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

```python
try:    
  if x < 0:  
	  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")
  print(x)
except:  
  print("Something went wrong")  
finally:  
  print("The 'try except' is finished")
```
