# Python

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

Python is a popular and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for various purposes such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. In this introduction, we'll cover some basic concepts and syntax of Python to get you started.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Python**: First, you need to install Python on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: After installing Python, you can choose a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run your Python code. Some popular choices include:
	- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
	- PyCharm
	- Atom
	- Sublime Text
	- IDLE (Python's built-in IDE)
	
3. **Install PIP**: PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.
	- If you do not have PIP installed, you can download and install it from this page: [https://pypi.org/project/pip/](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

## Basic Syntax

1. Basics
```python
# variable
x = 10

# This is a comment

# output
print("Hello, world")

# input
username = input("Enter username:")

# function
def myfunc():  
  global money # belongs to the global scope
  money = 300
```

2. Functions
```python
# define a function
def say_hello(name): 
	print("Hello " + name)

# lambda (1 line function)
sum = lambda a, b: a+b

# calling a function
say_hello("Wesley")
```

3. Data Types
```python
x = 10 # Integers
y = 3.14 # Floats
name = "Alice" # Strings
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Lists
coordinates = (10, 20) # Tuples
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30} # Dictionaries
```

4. Operators
```python
sum = 1 + 2
sub = 5 - 3
mul = 8 * 5
div = 10 / 2
flo = 11 // 2
mod = 33 % 2
exp = 2 ** 3
```

5. Conditionals
```python
if condition1:
    # code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # code to execute if all conditions are False
```

6. Loops
```python
while i < 5: # while	
	if i == 3:  
	    break # stop the loop
	if i == 2:
		continue # stop the current iteration
	print(i)
	i += 1

for x in range(6): # for in range
  print(x)

for x in fruits: # for in (interable)
  print(x)
```

7. Modules
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension `.py`:

```python
# mymodule.py
def greeting(name):  
  print("Hello, " + name)
```

Now we can use the module we just created, by using the `import` statement:

```python
import mymodule  
  
mymodule.greeting("Jonathan")
```
