## Arithmetic Operators

```python
sum = 1 + 2
sub = 5 - 3
mul = 8 * 5
div = 10 / 2
flo = 11 // 2
mod = 33 % 2
exp = 2 ** 3
```

## Assignment Operators

```python
x = 10  # Assignment
x += 5  # Addition Assignment
x -= 3  # Subtraction Assignment
x *= 2  # Multiplication Assignment
x /= 4  # Division Assignment
x //= 3  # Floor Division Assignment
x %= 2  # Modulus Assignment
x **= 3  # Exponentiation Assignment
```

## Comparison Operators

```python
x == 10
y != 5
z > 3
w < 8
a >= 20
b <= 15
```

## Logical Operators

```python
x and y
a or b
not z
```

## Identity Operators

```python
x is y
a is not b
```

## Membership Operators

```python
'apple' in fruits
'banana' not in fruits
```

## **Bitwise** Operators

```python
result = 0b1101 & 0b1010  # and
result = 0b1101 | 0b1010 # or
result = 0b1101 ^ 0b1010 # xor (only 1 is true)
result = ~0b1101 # not
result = 0b1101 << 2 # left shift
result = 0b1101 >> 2 # right shift
```
