Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

```python
import math

# Square root of x
math.sqrt(x)

# x raised to the power y
math.pow(x, y)

# Sine of x (in radians)
math.sin(x)

# Cosine of x (in radians)
math.cos(x)

# Value of pi (Ï€)
math.pi

# Value of Euler's number (e)
math.e

# Factorial of x
math.factorial(x)

# Largest integer not greater than x
math.floor(x)

# Smallest integer not less than x
math.ceil(x)

# Logarithm of x to the given base (default is natural logarithm)
math.log(x, base)

# Convert angle x from degrees to radians
math.radians(x)

# Convert angle x from radians to degrees
math.degrees(x)
```
