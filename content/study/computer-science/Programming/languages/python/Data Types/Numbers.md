There are three numeric types in Python:
- `int`
- `float`
- `complex`

## Int

Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
```python
x = 1  
y = 35656222554887711  
z = -3255522
```
## Float

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
```python
x = 1.10  
y = 1.0  
z = -35.59
```
## Complex

Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
```python
x = 3+5j  
y = 5j  
z = -5j
```

## Type Conversion

```python
a = float(x)
b = int(y)
c = complex(x)
```

## Random Number

```python
import random  
  
print(random.randrange(1, 10))
```
